# Popular Algorithms in Computer Science

This repo contains famous or useful algorithms implemented in Java.
I wrote these just for fun and practice. If you stumble upon this and
for some reason, want to use and replicate this code somewhere, I won't
mind a bit. If you think this code is shit, please explain to me why and
I will find time to make it better.
